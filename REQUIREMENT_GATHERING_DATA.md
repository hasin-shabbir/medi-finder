# Requirement Gathering Data

## Survey responses
<ol>
  <li>The survey gathered the occupation and age groups of the respondents to identify any target group. However, the age groups and occupations varied so much that no one group stood out.</li>
  <li>For the features, the survey asked "What kind of Drug Information is most useful to you for prescription drugs?". The most common answers were name, ingredients, dosage, side effects. </li>
  <li>72% of the respondents agreed that they have experienced medication error based out of unclear prescriptions or information available to them</li>
  <li>90% of respondents said that they look at the medicine packaging for relevant information</li>
  <li>83% of respondents said that they refer to online sources to find information about a particular medicine, 7% said only sometimes while 10% said that they don't</li>
  <li>To track prescription medicines and relevant information, the following methods were found to be most common: asking the doctor or nurse, following the written prescription, asking pharmacist, asking someone else and trying to remember, an online portal or application</li>
  <li>77% respondents agreed that their current method of finding and tracking information seems inconvenient to them</li>
  <li>85% respondents lied between 7-10 on a 10 point preference scale on how much would they prefer an application that would allow them to track information and prescriptions through scanning a QR code</li>
 </ol>

## Interview response
The following is the interview response from a pharmacist.

#### Initial impression:
As a pharmacist, I believe that providing detailed information about medications is crucial for ensuring that patients are able to properly use and understand their medications. However, the limited space on drug packages can make it difficult to include all of this information in a way that is easily accessible to patients. This is where an online application that provides this information through a QR code can be useful. By scanning the QR code, patients can easily access detailed information about their medication, including instructions for use, potential side effects, and potential drug interactions. This can help patients to better understand their medication and ensure that they are using it safely and effectively.

#### Do you get calls or inquiries regarding use of drugs or medication?
Yes, as a pharmacist, I receive calls and inquiries from patients about the use of their medications on a regular basis. This is an important part of my job, as it allows me to provide patients with the information and guidance they need to properly use their medications. I may receive calls about questions such as how to take a medication, what the possible side effects are, and whether a medication can be taken with other medications or substances. By answering these questions, I can help patients to understand their medications and ensure that they are using them safely and effectively.

#### How often does this happen?
It is difficult to say exactly how often I receive calls or inquiries about the use of medications, as it can vary depending on a number of factors. However, I would say that I receive at least a few calls or inquiries each day on average.

#### How do you resolve such issues?
When I receive a call or inquiry about the use of a medication, my first step is to listen carefully to the patient's question or concern. I then use my knowledge and training as a pharmacist to provide the patient with accurate and reliable information. This may involve consulting reference materials, such as medication guides or drug information databases, to ensure that I am providing the most up-to-date and accurate information. I also make sure to explain the information in a way that is easy for the patient to understand, and I encourage them to ask any follow-up questions they may have. By providing clear and accurate information, I can help patients to better understand their medications and use them safely and effectively.

#### Have you had incidents of users having Medication Error?
I take great care to ensure that patients receive the correct medications and use them safely and effectively. However, medication errors can still occur, and it is important for healthcare providers, including pharmacists, to be aware of this and take steps to prevent them. Medication errors can have serious consequences for patients, including adverse reactions and potential harm. In my experience, the most common causes of medication errors are errors in prescribing or dispensing medications, patients not taking their medications as prescribed, and patients not understanding how to properly use their medications. To prevent medication errors, it is important for healthcare providers to carefully check and double-check all medication orders and to provide patients with clear and accurate information about their medications.

#### How often does this happen
It is difficult to say exactly how often medication errors occur, as they can go undetected in some cases. However, studies have shown that medication errors are relatively common, and they can have serious consequences for patients. In some cases, medication errors can even be life-threatening. To minimize the risk of medication errors, it is important for healthcare providers to carefully follow best practices and to be vigilant in checking and double-checking all medication orders. By taking these steps, we can help to ensure that patients receive the correct medications and use them safely and effectively.

#### How do you resolve such issues?
If a medication error occurs, it is important to address it quickly and effectively in order to minimize the potential harm to the patient. The specific steps for resolving a medication error will depend on the nature of the error and the potential consequences for the patient. In some cases, the error may be discovered before the medication is given to the patient, in which case it can be corrected before it causes any harm. However, if the error has already been given to the patient, it may be necessary to take additional steps to address the error and minimize the potential harm to the patient. This could involve providing the correct medication, monitoring the patient for any adverse reactions, and providing any necessary treatment. It is also important to document the medication error and take steps to prevent similar errors from occurring in the future.

#### Do you see value in a system that allows information retrieval for medicines through a QR code on the pack?
Yes, I believe that a system that allows information retrieval for medicines through a QR code on the packaging could be very valuable. As I mentioned earlier, the limited space on drug packages can make it difficult to include all of the necessary information about a medication in a way that is easily accessible to patients. By using a QR code, patients can quickly and easily access detailed information about their medication by simply scanning the code with their smartphone. This can help patients to better understand their medication and use it safely and effectively. Additionally, the use of a QR code can make it easier for healthcare providers to access important information about a medication, such as potential drug interactions or side effects, which can help to prevent medication errors and ensure that patients receive the best possible care.

#### Do you see value in a system that allows information retrieval for prescriptions through a QR code on the pack?
Yes, I believe that a system that allows information retrieval for prescriptions through a QR code on the packaging could be very valuable. Similar to the value of a QR code for providing information about medications, a QR code for prescriptions can make it easier for patients and healthcare providers to access important information about a prescription. This can include information about the medication being prescribed, the dosage, and the instructions for use. By making this information easily accessible through a QR code, patients can better understand their prescriptions and ensure that they are taking their medications as prescribed. This can help to improve adherence to medication regimens and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Additionally, a QR code for prescriptions can help to prevent medication errors and ensure that patients receive the correct medication and dosage.
